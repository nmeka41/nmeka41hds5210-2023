**Functional Requirements**
* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc
* 5 points - Data from multiple sources has to be joined together at least twice

* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.

**(-2) Merging (joining) on a column that isn't unique ends up applything the rows from one side of the joint to multiple rows on the other side.  It ends up duplicating rows.  For example, neigher the diabetes or insurance data are unique at the level of Age and BMI.  One has gender as well, the other has some other attributes as well.**

**You did some good statistical analysis in this project.  That was above and beyond the scope, but nice job.  Great work on the final!**
